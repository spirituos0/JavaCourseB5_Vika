        Create a 2D int array
        The 2D array has 5 element arrays
        Each element array length is equal its index in the 2D array
        Each element array contains int values of its index number
        Print the 2D array
        So, the output must be: [[], [1], [2, 2], [3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4]]

        Note: There is no test case provided for this assignment in the Tests class. You can test it by yourself.
