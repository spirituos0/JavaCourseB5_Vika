          SET
            - is an unordered collection of objects;
            - cannot store duplicate objects.

          ArrayList VS Set
            1) - ArrayList can have duplicate values, but
               - Set cannot have duplicate elements

            2) - In List elements are stored in insertion order;
               - in Sets elements are stored like groups.
