              Array VS ArrayList

         1) - Array is a fixed-length data structure, so we can't change length of Array once created.
            - ArrayList is resizable (Dynamic Array).

         2) - Array can contain both primitives and objects
            - ArrayList can only store Objects

         3) - Also we can compare Array and ArrayList on
              how to calculate length of Array or size of ArrayList
            - We use length() method for arrays, size() method for ArrayList
